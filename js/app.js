  1. Add an event listener for the button
     # checkout http://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/

  2. Append an element with the class .add-cweep-form to the <header> element.
     Within the form, you'll need:
       - an <input> element with the class 'message'
       - an <a> element with the class 'button'

     # check out http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/

  3. When the .add-cweep button is clicked, add an <li> element
     to the .cweep-list <ul> element. You'll need to include the message from
     the form above.

  4. In addition to adding the .cweep li element, remove the form element.

  5. Try moving your html out into handlebars source tags in index.html.
     The scripts should have the attribute type="x-handlebars"
